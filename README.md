# NipsAutoSuggest
An English Autosuggest System from NIPS 2015 Corpus works as a Chrome extension on Overleaf.
The system uses word2vec to calculate distances between words and suggest next word ranked by distance while writing. 
I kept continuation of the project as private. I am no longer updating it.
